            "Enrique's Journey" is a non-fiction book written by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Sonia Nazario, which tells the story of a young Honduran boy's perilous journey to reunite with his mother in the United States.
<br><br>
The book is based on the true story of Enrique, who was only five years old when his mother Lourdes left Honduras in search of work in the United States. For over a decade, Enrique was left behind in the care of his grandmother and other family members, while his mother worked long hours in the U.S. to support him and his siblings back home.
<br><br>
When Enrique was 16 years old, he decided to embark on a dangerous journey across Central America and Mexico to reunite with his mother. The journey took him through treacherous terrain, including dense jungles and the hot and barren deserts of Mexico. Along the way, he encountered smugglers, gangs, and other migrants, and faced numerous challenges such as hunger, dehydration, and threats of violence.
<br><br>
Throughout the book, Nazario weaves together Enrique's personal story with the broader issues of immigration and family separation. She provides historical and political context for the circumstances that lead many people to make the dangerous journey northward, including poverty, violence, and political instability in their home countries.
<br><br>
Nazario's research included traveling along the same route as Enrique, conducting interviews with migrants, smugglers, and officials, and reviewing government records and other data. Her extensive reporting and vivid descriptions bring to life the harsh realities that migrants face, as well as the complexities of the immigration debate.
<br><br>
Published in 2006, "Enrique's Journey" became a national bestseller and won numerous awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing. The book has been translated into eight languages and is widely used in schools and universities to raise awareness of immigration issues. It has also inspired a number of related projects and initiatives, such as documentary films, theater productions, and advocacy campaigns.
