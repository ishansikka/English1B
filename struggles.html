        <h1>Hardships</h1>
        <p>The physical obstacles and risks that migrants encounter on their trips are described in the heartbreaking book Enrique's Journey. Enrique had several physical obstacles on his journey, including as beatings, train wrecks, and exploitation. The utilization of railroads was one of his journey's most dangerous elements. When refugees like Enrique and others were forced to jump onto moving trains, they frequently suffered life-threatening injuries or even died. Enrique saw fellow immigrants lose limbs or their lives while attempting to board moving trains, and he also experienced beatings and robberies at the hands of gangs while riding trains. Enrique and other migrants also experienced intimidation and extortion at the hands of law enforcement and other authorities that preyed on their vulnerabilities as unauthorized immigrants.
            <br><br>
            Those who wanted to take advantage of Enrique's defenselessness subjected him to abuse and exploitation as well. As an illustration, he toiled in hazardous and taxing circumstances on a tobacco farm, where he was subjected to hazardous chemicals and physically demanding work that jeopardized his health. Additionally, he was coerced into handing over his hard-earned money by smugglers and dishonest officials who threatened him with assault and imprisonment. The physical challenges and hazards that Enrique encountered on his journey were made worse by these unethical acts.
            <br><br>
            Enrique persisted in his quest to reunite with his mother despite these humbling physical obstacles. His tenacity in overcoming these problems is a stirring example of the fortitude and resiliency of migrants who struggle mightily to find a better life. Because of Enrique's tale, it is now more important than ever to strengthen migrant protections and raise public awareness of the dangers and hardships they face while traveling. Enrique's journey was physically dangerous and difficult, which highlights the critical need for more equitable and compassionate immigration laws that safeguard migrants and their rights.
