        <h1>Poverty</h1>
        <p>
            Poverty was one of the significant obstacles he faced on his journey. Enrique couldn't manage to get the necessities for survival like food, clothing, or shelter due to the fact he resided in an underdeveloped area of Honduras. He ultimately had to take up odd jobs in order to support himself and his family, which frequently prompted him to miss school. Enrique even had to make a hazardous journey on foot, on trains, and through dangerous areas because he couldn't buy a ticket to enter the United States legally. 
            <br><br>
            As a result, he was vulnerable to being taken advantage of by individuals who wanted to take advantage of his despair because he was an undocumented immigrant. Additionally, the people he met along the way, including smugglers, gang members, and corrupt officials, took advantage of him for money and mistreated him physically and psychologically. He has been subjected to violence, exploitation, and abuse, all of which were made worse by his lack of financial resources as it made it difficult for him to defend himself or seek assistance when he was in danger, leaving him open to robbery, assault, and sexual abuse, among other forms of violence. 
            <br><br>
            Through Enrique's story, the devastating repercussions of poverty on individuals and families are brought to light, highlighting the urgent need to eradicate poverty and injustice in our nations.
