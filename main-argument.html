        <p>
            The central claim of Sonia Nazario's book "Enrique's Journey" is that the harsh living circumstances in Central America and the US immigration policy are forcing children to run away from their homes and make dangerous journeys to the US in search of their parents who have immigrated there for employment. The narrative of the novel is on a young boy named Enrique who embarks on a hazardous trip from Honduras to America in order to find his mother. Nazario illuminates the physical, emotional, and psychological difficulties that these youngsters encounter when migrating, such as poverty, violence, abuse, and exploitation. The book also emphasises the complexity and intricacy of immigration policy and the need for fundamental changes to address the underlying reasons why people migrate from Central America to the United States.

        <p>
        In the non-fiction work "Enrique's Journey," Enrique, a youngster from Honduras, sets out on a dangerous journey to the US in order to find his mother, who deserted him when he was only five years old in order to pursue employment overseas.  The book covers not just Enrique's journey but also the adventures of other Central American migrants, illuminating the numerous difficulties they encounter.

        Nazario highlights the difficult living circumstances in Central America, such as poverty, violence, and corruption, that force individuals to evacuate their homes and look for a better life in the United States throughout the course of the book. She also describes how US immigration laws, such as strict border security and deportation procedures, make it impossible for migrants from Central America to enter the US legally, leaving them with no choice except to risk their lives crossing the border.
        <br><br>
        The book also emphasises the exploitation and abuse, including robbery, assault, and sexual assault, that many Central American migrants experience while migrating.  Nazario speaks with migrants and subject-matter specialists in order to gain a thorough understanding of the complicated reasons why people move as well as the difficulties they encounter on the route.
