        <h1>Corruption</h1>
        <p>
        One of the major challenges faced by Enrique in his journey was the corruption of the government officials. All the migrants had to come across so many corrupt officials, police, and smugglers who exploit their poverty and circumstances for personal gain.
        <br><br>
        In his entire journey, he came across corrupt officials who could do anything and can go to any level just to extort money from the poor migrants. If they say no to the officials, they beat the badly and exploit them in various inhumane ways. These corrupt officials prey on migrants' vulnerability, knowing that they have no legal status and no protection from the law.
        <br><br>
        Enrique also comes across dishonest smugglers who profit on the desperation of migrants. These smugglers frequently charge unreasonable rates to carry migrants across borders and offer subpar services, endangering their lives.
        <br><br>
        The corruption that Enrique experiences along his journey serves as another evidence of the harsh realities that migrants endure and the pressing need for stronger protections for migrants. These unethical actions also draw attention to the more widespread structural problems of impunity and corruption that plague many nations and obstruct the advancement of justice and human rights. Enrique's tale serves as an example of the critical need for legislation to guarantee that immigrants are treated fairly and are given legal protection.
