        <h1>Drug-Addiction</h1>
        <p>
            Enrique's journey is a painful narrative signifying a young man's attempts to find his mother in the United States. Enrique's battle with drug addiction is a reoccurring pattern highlighted throughout the entire book that drives home the damaging effects of substance misuse on people and families. When he was still residing in an underdeveloped area of Honduras, Enrique's drug use as a coping mechanism for the grief of his mother's absence is where his addiction to drugs started. His addiction intensified as he continued his journey to the United States, and he grew increasingly dependent on drugs to ease his loneliness and anguish.

            The effects of Enrique's drug addiction on his health and well-being were severe. He frequently went without food or sleep in favour of buying drugs with his limited funds. Due to his drug addiction, he also became more open to abuse and exploitation by those who were trying to make money out of him. Enrique's addiction also created disputes in his relationships with his family and friends as they strived to empathise and support him.

            Despite these hurdles, Enrique's addiction remained throughout his voyage. He attempted to stop using drugs multiple times, but owing to the numerous obstacles  he encountered, he struggled to maintain sobriety. His struggle to keep focused and on track caused his addiction to ultimately threaten to ruin his desire to reunite with his mother.
